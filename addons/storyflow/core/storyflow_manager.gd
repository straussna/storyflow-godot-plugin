## Emitted when the language MOVES, with the code it moved to. The one signal a game's own
## language menu needs: nothing in this plugin repaints text that is already on screen, so a
## switch reaches a read at the next read and everything else is the game's to refresh.
##
## IT FIRES WHEN THE LANGUAGE ACTUALLY MOVES, AND NEVER OTHERWISE. A refused code emits nothing
## (it changed nothing) and neither does re-setting the language already active. A project
## install emits only when the install MOVED the language - which happens when the incoming
## project cannot carry the code the player was on, so it snaps to that project's source
## language.
##
## ORDERING: whatever a handler can observe is already the new state. The language is assigned
## before the emit, so get_language answers the new code; and from an install the WHOLE project
## has been seeded first, so a handler reading a .sfd value, a global or a character sees the
## project it was just told about. A handler that re-enters set_language is measured against the
## new value, so it either no-ops or changes again and emits again.
##
## It lives on the manager rather than on StoryFlowComponent, where every other signal lives, for
## the same reason set_language does: the language is one game-wide value, and a component-side
## signal would fire once per component for one change. The manager is the plugin's autoload, so
## a game connects with get_node("/root/StoryFlowRuntime").language_changed.connect(...).

## Switch the language every StoryFlow string is read in. True when the game is now reading
## [param language_code].

## AN UNKNOWN OR EMPTY CODE IS A NO-OP: it warns, changes nothing and returns false. Falling back
## to the default instead would let a typo silently move the player out of the language they
## picked, and a caller that wants to know can read [method get_language]. The codes accepted are
## exactly the rows [method get_languages] returns, matched case-insensitively with the REGISTERED
## casing winning (StoryFlowLocalization.resolve_code, the one resolve point this shares with the
## project install). A project with no localization sidecar accepts only its source language, so
## this is a no-op there by construction rather than by a special case.
##
## WHAT MOVES, AND WHEN. Everything this plugin resolves AT READ TIME follows immediately -
## dialogue titles, text, text blocks, option labels, string and enum variable values, character
## string variables, map and array elements, AND character display names, which this engine stores
## as string-table keys on the runtime record and resolves per read. SINCE spec §2's amendment of
## 2026-08-27 that list includes .sfd DATA ASSET values: their read door resolves at read time
## too, so a switch reaches the very next get_data_asset_string or accessor node. What it never
## reaches is a .sfd value a script has WRITTEN - that is live data, not content, and the store's
## gate hands it back verbatim forever (StoryFlowDataAssetStore.try_read), which is the same
## seed-time posture the paragraph below describes, decided by provenance rather than by a
## clock. THE SEED-TIME POSTURE (ruled
## at LD2): a value a running script has already WRITTEN into live state - a Set String node, a
## SetCharacterVar - was resolved in the language current at the moment of the write and stays
## that text; a mid-session switch reaches those only at the next reset or dialogue start, which
## re-seeds them from the project. Exact mid-session re-seeding would need write-tracking to avoid
## clobbering the player's own progress, and is deliberately not built.
##
## PERSISTENCE IS THE GAME'S. This plugin keeps the choice for the SESSION only, and deliberately:
## the unified v1 save envelope carries the story state a slot owns (globals, characters,
## once-only options, the .sfd overlay) and is byte-shape-shared with the Unreal and Unity
## plugins - a language is not that kind of thing. It must survive with no save file at all, apply
## before any save is loaded, and not differ per slot. The HTML runtime reaches the same
## conclusion and keeps it beside its volume settings rather than in the envelope. In Godot the
## settings lane already exists and belongs to the game: persist the code yourself (a ConfigFile
## in user://, your own options screen) and call this once at boot, before the first dialogue.

##    rewriting. A save that predates a newly added variable therefore leaves it alone instead of
##    deleting it, and an id the project no longer declares is dropped.
##  - ONCE-ONLY OPTIONS and the .sfd OVERLAY are REPLACED wholesale. Each is one complete SET
##    rather than a collection of independent entries: an option key absent from the save means
##    the player has not used it, and an overlay entry absent from the save means that variable

# Data Assets - the host surface (engine contract §4)
# =============================================================================
#
# THE SAME LADDER THE COMPONENT USES, reached through the same shared access layer
# (storyflow_data_asset_access.gd) so the two public doors cannot answer one question two ways -
# the rule the engine contract states for mirrored surfaces.
#
# WHY THE MANAGER HAS THESE AT ALL: reading a Data Asset never needed a running dialogue, but it
# did need a COMPONENT OBJECT, because the ladder lived on the component. A pause menu, an
# inventory screen or a save-slot list had to stand one up just to read a data table. Unity's
# plugin has mirrored the surface on its manager all along; this is the Godot half.
#
# Writes advance a shared revision. Live contexts observe it before evaluating cached
# conditions, preserving completed execution outputs and avoiding reentrant advancement.
#
# THE PRE-LOCALIZATION FALLBACK is the project's SOURCE language, which is what a sidecar-less
# project's strings are keyed by; a localized project ignores it (language_for answers the active
# language then). A component passes its own `language_code` export here instead, so on a
# pre-localization project the two doors agree exactly when that export is the default - an
# author who set a component's export to something else on such a project has two components
# disagreeing with each other already, and this surface sides with the project.
